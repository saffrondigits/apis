In Go (Golang), a closure is a function that references variables declared outside of its own scope. This means it can access and assign values to these variables even after the scope in which they were declared has been destroyed1.

Here’s an example to illustrate this concept:

```
package main
import "fmt"

func newCounter() func() int {
    GFG := 0
    return func() int {
        GFG += 1
        return GFG
    }
}

func main() {
    counter := newCounter()
    fmt.Println(counter())
    fmt.Println(counter())
}

```

Here’s another example of a closure in Go:

```
package main
import "fmt"

// outer function
func greet() func() string {
    // variable defined outside the inner function
    name := "John"

    // return a nested anonymous function
    return func() string {
        name = "Hi " + name
        return name
    }
}

func main() {
    // call the outer function
    message := greet()

    // call the inner function
    fmt.Println(message())
}

```

In this example, the greet function returns an anonymous function that references the name variable1. When we call greet, it returns this anonymous function, which we assign to message. Even though the greet function has finished executing (and so the name variable should be destroyed), we can still access name when we call message(). This is because the anonymous function acts as a closure, maintaining access to name even after greet has finished1.
